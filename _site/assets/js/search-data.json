Due dates: . Part I is due on July 18th at 10pm PST | Part II is due on August 1st at 10pm PST | Part III is due on August 15th at 12pm noon PST | . Make sure to provide enough time for Gradescope submission to be uploaded if you include large visualizations. . Late penalty: 50% late penalty if submitted within 24 hours of due date, no marks for assignments submitted thereafter. | . Submission Process (READ CAREFULLY): . Download your PDF from Datahub using the File Viewer on the bottom right panel of RStudio. (More -&gt; Export) | Please submit a PDF of your group project to Gradescope here. When turning in each part, please submit all questions through the current part. For example when turning in Part II, include all questions from Part I. | Make sure to add all of your group members to the submission. Only one group member has to submit. Non-submitting group members should confirm that the project submission appears in their gradescope account. | Please answer each problem on a new page. You can specify a pagebreak in Rmd using ‘ newpage’. | You must indicate on Gradescope which questions are on which pages. If the page thumbnails make it difficult to see on Gradescope, open the PDF in a PDF viewer at the same time so you can make the selections accurately. | If the submission guidelines are not followed, we may deduct points, as this creates a logistic burden on our end to have to resolve individual cases. | . . Instructions: . Your task for this project is to find data that is related to health, public health, biology, sociology, demography, justice, or another topic affiliated with public health or biology. The data should have human beings as the unit of analysis, or be based on aggregates of human data (for example rates of mortality) for multiple units of analysis (multiple hospitals/clinics etc). . These data could be a preexisting data set that has been made publicly available on the Internet, data you have access to (and permission to use) from your lab or internship, or, less frequently, something you create (with appropriate permission) from a hard copy. You will then import your data into R and use it to demonstrate concepts covered in class in three submissions, each focused on one of the three sections of the class: . Part I: Collecting, Exploring, and Visualizing Data (Based on material in the textbook Edition 4 Chapters 1-8 and early lectures on dplyr and ggplot2) | Part II: From Chance to Inference (Edition 4 Chapters 9-16) | Part III: Statistical Inference (Edition 4 Chapters 17-25 and lectures on bootstrapping and permutation tests) | . The objectives of this assignment are to: . Gain competence finding public health data and reading it into R to perform your own analyses. | Apply the PPDAC framework to a question of your choosing. | Develop your ability to choose statistical methods appropriately. | Demonstrate your newly-acquired statistical skills. | Demonstrate your ability to communicate statistical analyses and findings. | . Because we are asking you to provide some visualizations and use the same dataset for parts II and III of the project, make sure that you choose a dataset with enough observations (rows) to have something that you can interpret. Confirm with your supporting GSI that you have an appropriate dataset. You will also need a dataset large enough so that you can run a statistical test in part III. A good general guide here is to choose a dataset with at least 100 observations, and at least 30 in each group if you are comparing across groups. For example, if you are answering a question about mean days in the ICU between groups of patients exposed to some intervention procedure vs. not, you would want to have data on at least 100 patients, at least 30 of which had undergone the intervention and at least 30 of whom had not. Your outcome of interest should be something that can be defined as a continuous, discrete or binary variable. . Data Skills Demonstration Project Part I .",

Extra Credit Assignments Extra Credit - Compelling Study | Extra Credit - Question Creation | Extra Credit - Statistics is Everywhere | . Extra Credit - Compelling Study . One of the skills we hope that you develop during this course is the ability to assess scientific information with a critical eye. We particularly hope that you will be able to apply this skill to assessing information that is relevant to decisions you or people you care about. . . Extra Credit - Question Creation . If you would like to recover points lost on the first or second midterm you have the option of an extra credit assignment. To recover up to 3 marks on the midterm, reinforce your understanding, and to show your creativity, you can make a short explanation of a concept from the course that includes sample question and solution guide corresponding to topics covered during that lecture. . . Extra Credit - Statistics is Everywhere . Throughout the term, we have (and will continue to) include a recurring “Statistics is Everywhere” segment, highlighting statistical content you may see in news, social media, or other places. The goal is to demonstrate the relevance of statistics to the world around us. One of the skills we hope you will develop is an ability to think critically about the quality of statistical information and about how it is presented in popular (nonscientific) media. We hope that through this course we can equip you to be more discerning consumers of statistical information, and to share your critical thinking with others. . For this extra credit assignment, we are asking you to provide your own “Statistics is Everywhere” example and demonstrate this kind of critical thinking .",

Goals . Build strong foundations in statistics and introduce students to programming to prepare students for more advanced courses involving data analysis. | Foster a mindset of statistical thinking to give students the tools to understand experiments and research studies and evaluate their validity. | Empower students to address real-world problems with technical prowess. | Develop the skills to assess statistical information in scientific and lay publications, and to communicate statistical information to various audiences. | . Course Description . This course is an introduction to statistics and data science, primarily for MPH and undergraduate public health majors, and others interested in public health topics. The course can be divided into three parts: . Part I: We will be focusing on learning to explore and summarize univariate and bivariate distributions. We will be using the R statistical software to do this, specifically, we will use the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. | Part II: We will be learning about classical problems in probability and the some commonly used probability distributions: the Normal, Binomial, and Poisson distributions. In Part II we will also make the link between theoretical distributions and sampled distributions and cover a key concept called the Central Limit Theorem. | Part III: We introduce statistical inference, the process of estimating statistics from samples to make inference about populations. | . Throughout the course, we will follow the PPDAC model, which stands for “Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion”. .",
