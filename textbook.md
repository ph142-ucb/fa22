-----------------

### Textbook Reservations

The digital textbook is available on HathiTrust through their [Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS)](https://www.hathitrust.org/ETAS-User-Information). Unfortunately,
only **three copies** of "The Practice of Statistics in the Life Sciences" are available for checkout at a time.

Each student will have **one hour** of access to the textbook everytime they check out through HathiTrust. The system will automatically renew the reservation at the end of the hour
unless another student requests for the book in advance (in the case where all three textbooks are being used concurrently).

Once finished with the textbook, please remember to click on the **check out early** button to allow other students to access the textbook.
