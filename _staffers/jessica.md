Hi everyone! I am an incoming 4+1 MPH student in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics program. My research interests lie in Asian and Pacific Islander health, community health, and social epidemiology. Currently, I work on data disaggregation advocacy and research interventions for reducing obesity and cancer disparities in the Pacific Islander community. In my free time I enjoy hiking, painting, and photography. Excited to meet with you all!
