Hello everyone! My name is Noel and I’m a second year MA/PhD student in biostatistics; I’m queer, first-generation Mexican-American, and I was a transfer student at UC Berkeley back in 2013. I’m originally from the Fresno area (saludos to all the Central Valley Cal students) and I’ve been living in the East Bay for 9 years now. I’m interested in causal inference and targeted learning, and its application on longitudinal electronic health records, specifically to improve mental health outcomes within BIPOC communities and immigrant populations. I’m looking forward to meeting y’all this fall.
