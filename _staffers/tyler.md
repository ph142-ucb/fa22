Hey everyone! My name is Tyler and this is my second year at Berkeley as a MA/PhD student. I was born and raised in Utah, though I lived two years in Southern California near San Bernardino. I graduated from BYU in Applied and Computational Mathematics and am passionate about data-driven healthcare and personalized medicine. Outside of school, I love running, volleyball, swimming, board/card games, and socializing. Look forward to meeting you!
