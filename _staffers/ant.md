Hello everyone! My name is Antonia Gibbs and I am an incoming 4+1 MPH student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. My interest in research lies in genetic epidemiology, particularly with a focus in using admixed populations to investigate genetic risks in non-European populations. On my off time I enjoy lounging with my cat, painting, and watching anime. Iâ€™m excited to meet and work with you all this summer!
