Hi everyone! I am a second year Biostatistics Phd student. I was born in China and came to US at 2018. My research interests include Graphical model, high-dimensional data, and reinforcement learning. On my spare time, I will go to the beach just one mile away from my home. Look forward to meeting you all!
