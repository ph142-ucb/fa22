Hey yâ€™all! My name is Shazia and I am a 4+1 Epidemiology/Biostatistics MPH student with a concentration in Data Science. I grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas and went to undergrad at Cal. Previously, I conducted research on pulmonary fibrosis at UCSF in a molecular biology lab. My current research interests focus on substance use and the intersection between big data and public health. In my free time I enjoy painting, photography, spending time with my dog, and exploring the Bay Area.
