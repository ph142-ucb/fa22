Hi everyone! My name is Yunwen but you can me Wendy. I am a first year MA student in biostatistics and just graduated from McGill University with a major in Computer Science and Biology. In my free time I enjoy hiking and playing games with my friends on Switch. My research interest will lie in the application of statistics and computer science in the biomedical field, such as EHR and precision medicine.
