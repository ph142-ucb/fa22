Hi all! My name is Mitchell and I am an incoming 4+1 MPH student in Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology. I am interested in the HIV/AIDS field, innovation in new antiretroviral therapies, and how we can expand access to these therapies both domestically and abroad. I enjoy going to ice cream places around the Bay. Very excited to support you all this summer!
