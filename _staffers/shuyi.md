Hi! My name is Shuyi and I also go by Judy. I am a first year MA in Biostatistics student. I just graduated from UC San Diego with a major in Data Science and a minor in Biology. My research interests are in math modeling about infectious disease. I enjoy hiking and traveling, and recently I start rock climbing and surfing. Looking forward to having a wonderful semester with yall!
