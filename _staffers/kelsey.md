Hi everyone! My name is Kelsey and I am an incoming second year MPH student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I am originally from Los Angeles, completed my undergrad at Cal in May 2020 (go bears!) and am super excited to be on the PH142 team again! I spend most of my free time swimming or finding the closest beach. I canâ€™t wait for a wonderful summer semester with all of you!
